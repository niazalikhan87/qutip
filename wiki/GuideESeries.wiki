#summary An overview of exponential series.

= Exponential-series representation of time-dependent quantum objects =

The eseries object in QuTiP is a representation of an exponential-series expansion of time-dependent quantum objects (a concept borrowed from the quantum optics toolbox). 

An exponential series is parameterized by its amplitude coefficients `c_i` and rates `r_i`, so that the series takes the form `eseries(t) = sum_i c_i exp(r_i * t)`. The coefficients are typically quantum objects (type Qobj: states, operators, etc.), so that the value of the eseries also is a quantum object, and the rates can be either real or complex numbers. Note that all amplitude coefficients in an exponential series must be of the same dimensions and composition. 

In QuTiP, an exponential series object is constructed by creating an instance of the class *eseries*,
{{{
>> es1 = eseries(sigmax(), 1j)
}}}
where the first argument is the amplitude coefficient (here, the sigma-X operator), and the second argument is the rate. The eseries in this example represents the time-dependent operator `sigmax() * exp(1j * t)`. 

To add more terms to an *eseries* object we simply add *eseries* object using the `+` operator:
{{{
>> es2 = eseries(sigmax(), 1j * omega) + eseries(sigmax(), -1j * omega)
}}}
