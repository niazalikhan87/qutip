#guide to plotting with the Bloch sphere class

==Intro==
When studying the dynamics of a two-level system, it is often convent to visualize the state of the system by plotting the state-vector on the Bloch sphere.  In QuTiP, we have created the Bloch class to allow for easy creation and manipulation of of data sets, both vectors and data points, on the Bloch sphere.

==The Bloch class==
In QuTiP, creating a Bloch sphere is accomplished by calling:
{{{
b=Bloch()
}}}
which will load an instance of the Bloch class.  Before getting into the details of this object, we can plot the blank Bloch sphere associated with this object via:
{{{
b.show()
}}}

In addition to the `show()` command, the Bloch class has the following functions:

||Name|| Input Parameters || Usage ||
||add_points|| list/array of (x,y,z) points|| adds a single or set of data points to be plotted on the sphere||
||add_vectors|| list/array of  (x,y,z) points giving direction and length of state vectors|| adds single or multiple  vectors to plot|| 
||save||format (optional) format of output file, direc (optional) output directory|| saves Bloch sphere as a file with format (default='png') to given directory (default = current working directory)||
||show|| none || creates Bloch sphere with given data sets||
