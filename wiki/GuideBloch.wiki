#guide to plotting with the Bloch sphere class

==Intro==
When studying the dynamics of a two-level system, it is often convent to visualize the state of the system by plotting the state-vector on the Bloch sphere.  In QuTiP, we have created the Bloch class to allow for easy creation and manipulation of data sets, both vectors and data points, on the Bloch sphere.

==The Bloch class==
In QuTiP, creating a Bloch sphere is accomplished by calling:
{{{
b=Bloch()
}}}
which will load an instance of the Bloch class.  Before getting into the details of this object, we can simply plot the blank Bloch sphere associated with this instance via:
{{{
b.show()
}}}

In addition to the `show()` command, the Bloch class has the following functions:

||Name|| Input Parameters || Usage ||
||add_points|| list/array of (x,y,z) points|| adds a single or set of data points to be plotted on the sphere||
||add_states|| Qobj representing state or density matrix of a two-level system|| can only handle a single input state||
||add_vectors|| list/array of  (x,y,z) points giving direction and length of state vectors|| adds single or multiple  vectors to plot|| 
||save||format (optional) format of output file, direc (optional) output directory|| saves Bloch sphere as a file with format (default='png') to given directory (default = current working directory)||
||show|| none || creates Bloch sphere with given data sets||

As an example, we can add a single data point:
{{{
pnt=[1/sqrt(3),1/sqrt(3),1/sqrt(3)]
b.add_points(pnt)
b.show()
}}}
http://qutip.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/bloch_1pnt.png

and then a single vector:
{{{
vec=[0,1,0]
b.add_vectors(pnt)
b.show()
}}}
http://qutip.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/bloch_pnt+vec.png

and then add another vector corresponding to the |up> state:
{{{
up=basis(2,0)
b.add_states(up)
b.show()
}}}
http://qutip.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/bloch_pnt+vec+state.png

Notice that when we add more than a single vector (or data point), a different color will automatically be applied to the later data set (mod 4).  In total, the code for constructing our Bloch sphere with two vectors and a single data point is:
{{{
b=Bloch()
pnt=[1/sqrt(3),1/sqrt(3),1/sqrt(3)]
b.add_points(pnt)
#b.show()
vec=[0,1,0]
b.add_vectors(pnt)
#b.show()
up=basis(2,0)
b.add_states(up)
b.show()
}}}
where we have commented out the extra `show()` commands.
