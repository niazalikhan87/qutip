#summary Qutip installation instructions
*<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />*

=General Installation Requirements =
QuTiP requires the following packages to run:

|| *Package* || *Version* || *Details* ||
|| Python || 2.6+ (not 3) || Requires multiprocessing (v2.6 and higher only).  At present, Matplotlib does not work for Python 3 ||
|| Numpy || 1.5.1+ || Not tested on lower versions. ||
|| Scipy || 0.8+ || Not tested on lower versions (use 0.9+ if possible). ||
|| Matplotlib || 1.0.1+ || Some plotting routines do not work on lower versions. ||
|| Qt libraries || 4.7.3+|| Not tested on lower versions.||
|| PyQt4 || 4.8+ || Optional, required only for GUI elements. Can be substituted with PySide. ||
|| PySide || 1.0+ || Optional, required only for GUI elements. PyQt4 can be used instead. ||
|| PyObjC || 2.2+ || *MAC ONLY.* Very optional.  Needed only for a GUI Monte-Carlo progress bar on the mac. Other GUI elements will work without this package.||

*On all platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows), QuTiP works "out-of-the-box" using the [http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php Enthought Python Distribution] version 7.1 or higher.  This distribution is created by the developers of Numpy and Scipy, is free for academic use, and does not require a compiler.*

= Installation on Ubuntu Linux =

 * Requirements. 
{{{
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
sudo apt-get install python-pyside or sudo apt-get install python-pyqt4
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
}}}
At present, Ubuntu 11.04 and lower do not have Matplotlib>=1.0 therefore we need to add the unofficial repository
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bgamari/matplotlib-unofficial
sudo apt-get update
}}}
before running
{{{
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
}}}

 * QuTiP installation
{{{
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

= Installation on Mac OS X (10.6) =

On the Mac, it is recommended that you install the *[http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php Enthought Python Distribution]* version 7.1 or higher to satisfy the QuTiP dependencies.  Otherwise, the required libraries can be built via [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts] or [http://www.finkproject.org/ Fink].  

A further possibility is to use the *[http://stronginference.com/scipy-superpack/ Scipy Superpack installer script]*.  In order to have GUI elements using this method, you need to further install the Qt4 and PySide packages at:

[http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySide_Binaries_MacOSX]


= Installation on Microsoft Windows =
The developers of QuTiP have not touched Windows in several years, and will be continuing this trend for the foreseeable future.  Therefore we recommend the *[http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php Enthought Python Distribution]* version 7.1 or higher to satisfy the QuTiP dependencies.

= Does it work? =
To verify that everything is installed properly, from the python command line:
{{{
from qutip import *
}}}
If nothing but another command prompt appears then you are ready to go.  To see if the GUI components are working, after the import statement type:
{{{
about()
}}}
which will pop-up the about box for QuTiP which gives you information on the installed version of QuTiP and its dependencies.  If instead you get command-line output, then your graphics is not installed properly or unavailable.
