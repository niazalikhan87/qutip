== Intro ==
The key difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the use of operators instead of numbers as variables.  Moreover, we need to specify state vectors and their properties. Therefore, in computing the dynamics of quantum systems we need a data structure that is capable of encapsulating the properties of a quantum operator and ket/bra vectors.  The quantum object class, Qobj, accomplishes this using matrix representation.

To begin, let us create a blank Qobj: *(in Python, Class objects differ from functions in the use of a beginning capital letter)*

{{{
Qobj() 
}}}

which returns `<qutip.Qobj.Qobj instance at 0x3cfbfc8>` indicating that we have created a instance of a Qobj class object.  This however is not very insightful, therefore we use the `print` command to get the relevant information about a quantum object:
{{{
print Qobj()
}}}
returning,
{{{
Quantum object: dims = [[1], [1]], shape = [1, 1]
Qobj data = 
[[0]]
}}}
where we now see the blank `Qobj` object dimensions, shape, and data.  Here the data corresponds to a 1x1-dimensional matrix consisting of a single zero entry.  We can create a `Qobj` with a user defined data set by passing a list or array of data into the `Qobj`:
{{{
print Qobj([1,2,3,4,5])

Quantum object: dims = [[1], [5]], shape = [1, 5]
Qobj data = 
[[1 2 3 4 5]]

x=array([[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]])
print Qobj(x)

Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1]
Qobj data = 
[[1]
 [2]
 [3]
 [4]
 [5]]

r=random((4,4))
print Qobj(r)

Quantum object: dims = [[4], [4]], shape = [4, 4]
Qobj data = 
[[ 0.76799998  0.06936066  0.10970546  0.13724402]
 [ 0.70644984  0.15371775  0.90649545  0.15349102]
 [ 0.69515726  0.13609801  0.52707457  0.6484309 ]
 [ 0.78328543  0.87295996  0.58964046  0.3998962 ]]

}}}
Notice how both the dims and shape change according to the input data.  Although dims and shape appear to have the same function, the difference will become quite clear in the section on tensor products and partial traces.


== States and operators ==
Now, unless you have lots of free time, specifying the data for each object is inefficient.  Even more so when most objects correspond to commonly used types such as the ladder operators of a harmonic oscillator,the Pauli spin operators for a two-level system, or state vectors such as Fock states.  Therefore, QuTiP includes predefined objects for a variety of states and operators.

|| *States* || *Command* (# means optional) || *Inputs*||
|| Fock state ket vector || basis(N,#m) / fock(N,#m) || N = number of levels in Hilbert space, m = level containing excitation (0 if no m given)  ||
|| Fock density matrix (outer product of basis) ||fock_dm(N,#p) || same as basis(N,m) / fock(N,m) ||
|| Coherent state || coherent(N,alpha) || alpha = complex number (eigenvalue) for requested coherent state ||
|| Coherent density matrix (outer product of coherent) || coherent_dm(N,alpha) || same as coherent(N,alpha) ||
|| Thermal density matrix (for n particles) || thermal_dm(N,n) || n = expectation value for number of particles ||


|| *Operators* || *Command* (# is optional) || *Inputs* ||
|| Identity || qeye(N) || N = number of levels in Hilbert space ||
|| Lowering (destruction) operator || destroy(N) || same as above   ||
|| Raising (creation) operator || create(N) || same as above  ||
|| Number operator || num(N) || same as above  ||
|| Sigma-X || sigmax() || - ||
|| Sigma-Y || sigmay() || - ||
|| Sigma-Z || sigmaz() || - ||
|| Sigma plus || sigmap() || - ||
|| Sigma minus || sigmam() || - ||
|| Higher spin operators || jmat(j,d) || j = integer or half-integer representing spin, d = 'x', 'y', 'z', '+', or '-' ||

As an example, we give the output for a few of these objects:

{{{
print basis(5,3)

Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1]
Qobj data = 
[[ 0.]
 [ 0.]
 [ 0.]

print coherent(5,0.5-0.5j)

print sigmaz()

== Qobj properties ==
We have seen that a quantum object has three internal attributes, the data, dims, and shape properties.  These can be accessed in the following way:
{{{
q=destroy(4)
print q.dims
[[4], [4]]

print q.shape
[4, 4]
}}}  
In general, the properties of a Qobj object (or any Python class) can be retrieved using the `Q.prop` notation.  In addition to the properties shown with the `print` function, the Qobj class also has the following:

|| *Property* || *Command* || *Description* ||
|| Data || Q.data || Matrix representing state or operator ||
|| Dimensions || Q.dims || List keeping track of shapes for individual components of a multipartite system (for tensor products and partial traces) ||
|| Shape || Q.shape || Dimensions of underlying data matrix ||
|| is Hermitian? || Q.isherm || Is the operator Hermitian or not ||
|| Type || Q.type || Is object of type 'ket, 'bra', 'oper', or 'super' ||

For the destruction operator above:
{{{
q.type
'oper'

q.isherm
False

q.data
<4x4 sparse matrix of type '<type 'numpy.float64'>'
	with 3 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

}}}
The data property returns a message stating that the data is a sparse matrix.  All Qobj's store their data as a sparse matrix to save memory.  To access the underlying matrix one needs to use the `full()` function as described in the functions section.

== Qobj math ==
The rules for mathematical operations on Qobj's is similar to standard matrix arithmetic:
{{{
q=destroy(4)
x=sigmax()

print q+5
Quantum object: dims = [[4], [4]], shape = [4, 4]
Qobj data = 
[[ 5.          6.          5.          5.        ]
 [ 5.          5.          6.41421356  5.        ]
 [ 5.          5.          5.          6.73205081]
 [ 5.          5.          5.          5.        ]]

print x*x
Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = [2, 2]
Qobj data = 
[[ 1.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.]]

print q**3
Quantum object: dims = [[4], [4]], shape = [4, 4]
Qobj data = 
[[ 0.          0.          0.          2.44948974]
 [ 0.          0.          0.          0.        ]
 [ 0.          0.          0.          0.        ]
 [ 0.          0.          0.          0.        ]]

print x/sqrt(2)
Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = [2, 2]
Qobj data = 
[[ 0.          0.70710678]
 [ 0.70710678  0.        ]]

}}} 
of course, like matrices, multiplying two objects of incompatible shape throws an error:
{{{
q*x
TypeError: Incompatible Qobj shapes
}}}
In addition, the logic operators is equal `==` and is not equal `!=` are also supported.

== Functions operating on Qobj class ==
Like properties, the quantum object class has defined functions which operate only on members of the Qobj class.  For a general quantum object `Q`:

|| *Function* || *Command* || *Description* ||
|| Dagger (adjoint) || Q.dag() || Returns adjoint (dagger) of object ||
|| Diagonal || Q.diag() || Returns the diagonal elements of  Qobj ||
|| Exponential || Q.expm() || Returns matrix exponential of operator ||
|| Full || Q.full() || Returns full (not sparse) array of Q's data property||
|| Norm || Q.norm() || Returns L2 norm for states, trace norm for operators ||
|| Sqrt || Q.sqrtm() || Returns matrix sqrt of operator ||
|| Trace || Q.tr() || Returns trace of quantum object ||
|| Unit || Q.unit() || Returns normalised (unit) vector Q/Q.norm()||
