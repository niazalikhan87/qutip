Here we demonstrate how to calculate two-time correlation functions in QuTiP. Using the quantum regression theorem, we apply use the equation of motion for the system itself also to calculate two-time correlation functions. In QuTiP, there are family functions that assists in this process: *correlation_ode*, *correlation_es*, *correlation_mc*, and *correlation_ss_ode*, *correlation_ss_es*, *correlation_ss_mc*. As the names suggest, these functions use the ODE, the exponential series, and the Monte-Carlo solvers, respectively, to evolve the correlation functions in time. The following table describes in detail the usage of each function:


|| *Function* || *Input parameters" || *Usage* ||

|| `correlation_ss_es` || `H` - the Hamiltonian, `tlist` - list of times to evaluate the correlation function, `c_op_list` - list of collapse operator, `a_op` and `b_op` - the operators for which to calculate correlations. || Calculates the steady state correlation <a(0)b(tau)>, using the Exponential series solver. ||
|| `correlation_ss_ode` || Same as above. || Calculates the steady state correlation <a(0)b(tau)>, using the ODE solver. ||
|| `correlation_ss_mc`  || Same as above. || Calculates the steady state correlation <a(0)b(tau)>, using the Monte-Carlo evolution. ||
|| `correlation_es` || `H` - the Hamiltonian, `rho0` - initial state of the system, `t1list` and `t2list`- list of times to evaluate the correlation function (t1 of operator `a` and t1+t2 for operator `b`), `c_op_list` - list of collapse operator, `a_op` and `b_op` - the operators for which to calculate correlations. || Calculates the state correlation <a(t1)b(t1+t2)>, using the Exponential series solver. ||
|| `correlation_ode` || Same as above. || Calculates the steady state correlation <a(t1)b(t1+t2)>, using the ODE solver. ||
|| `correlation_mc`  || Same as above. || Calculates the steady state correlation <a(t1)b(t1+t2)>, using the Monte-Carlo evolution. ||
