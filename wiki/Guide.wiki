#Guide to QuTiP structures and functions

= Intoduction =

The goal of this guide is to introduce you to the basic structures and functions that make up QuTiP.  If you are familiar with the Quantum Optics Toolbox, then you should have no problem getting used to QuTiP.  The guide is broken up into sections, each highlighting a specific set of functionalities.  In combination with the examples, this guide should provide a more or less complete overview.

= Sections =

* [GuideBasics Qobj Basics]* - Describes the base object class of QuTiP, the quantum object (Qobj).

*[GuideComposite  Tensor product/Partial trace]* - How to build and decompose composite states using the *[Functions#tensor(args) tensor product]* and *[Functions#ptrace(rho,sel) partial trace]* functions.

*[GuideDynamics Quantum dynamics]* - An overview of the multiple ways in which to calculate the evolution of a quantum system.

*[GuideParfor Parallel computation with parfor]* - Using the *[Functions#parfor(func,frange) parfor]* function to speedup tasks.
