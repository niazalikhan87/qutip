The QuTiP library depends on the excellent Numpy and Scipy numerical packages. In addition, graphical output is provided by Matplotlib. QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of Hamiltonian's, including those with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications. QuTiP is freely available for use and/or modification on all Unix based platforms. Being free of any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics and dynamics in the classroom.} license GPL3 maintainers {pnation openmaintainer} categories {python science} version 2.0.0 revision 0
