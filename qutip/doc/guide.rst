QuTiP Users Guide
*****************

The goal of this guide is to introduce you to the basic structures and functions that make up QuTiP.  If you are familiar with the Quantum Optics Toolbox, then you should have no problem getting used to QuTiP.  The guide is broken up into sections, each highlighting a specific set of functionalities.  In combination with the examples, this guide should provide a more or less complete overview.
