QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python
================================

QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamcis of open quantum systems. The QuTiP library depends on the excellent Numpy and Scipy numerical packages. In addition, graphical output is provided by Matplotlib. QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of Hamiltonianâ€™s, including those with arbitrary time-dependent, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications. QuTiP is freely avaliable for use and/or modification on all major platforms. Being free of any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics and dynamics in the classroom.
