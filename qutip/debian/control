Description: QuTiP is an open-source framework for solving the dynamics of both open and closed quantum systems. The focus of QuTiP is on systems who's Hamiltonian is composed of harmonic oscillator modes, and multi-level (typically two-levels) atoms, where the Hilbert space may be constructed using the Fock basis. This large class of Hamiltonians appears in a wide variety of physical problems, including those in quantum optics, trapped ions, superconducting circuit devices, and mechanical systems in the quantum regime.
