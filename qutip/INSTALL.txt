**********************
* GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
**********************
Package        Version        Details
-------        -------        --------
Python	      2.6+ (not 3)	  Requires multiprocessing (v2.6 and higher only). At present, Matplotlib does not work for Python 3
Numpy	      1.5.1+	      Not tested on lower versions.
Scipy	      0.8+	          Not tested on lower versions (use 0.9+ if possible).
Matplotlib	  1.0.1+	      Some plotting routines do not work on lower versions.
Qt libraries  4.7.3+	      Optional. For GUI elements only. Not tested on lower versions.
PyQt4	      4.8+	          Optional, required only for GUI elements. Can be substituted with PySide (recommended).
PySide?	      1.0.2+	      Optional, required only for GUI elements. PyQt4 may be used instead.
PyObjC	      2.2+	          MAC ONLY. Very optional. Needed only for a GUI Monte-Carlo progress bar on the mac. Other GUI elements will work without this package.
GCC Compiler  4.2+	          Needed for compiling Cython files.


UBUNTU LINUX (RECOMMENDED)
--------------------------

>>> sudo apt-get install python-scipy
>>> sudo apt-get install python-pyside
>>> sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
>>> sudo apt-get install python-dev

Ubuntu 11.04 and lower do not have Matplotlib>=1.0, and we therefore need to add the unofficial repository (in Ubuntu 11.10, skip this step)

>>> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bgamari/matplotlib-unofficial
>>> sudo apt-get update

before running

>>> sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

QuTiP installation:

>>> sudo python setup.py install

APPLE MAC OSX (10.6+)
---------------------
If you have not done so already, install the Apple XCode developer tools from the Apple App Store.

On the Mac, it is recommended that you install the required libraries via MacPorts. 
After installing with MacPorts, you may need to change your matplotlib backend

>>> sudo open -a TextEdit /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/\
python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc

on line #31 to read:

>>> backend      : MacOSX

One can also use the Enthought Python Distribution version 7.1 or higher to satisfy the QuTiP dependencies.

A further possibility is to use the Scipy Superpack installer script. 
In order to have GUI elements using this method, you need to further install the Qt4 and PySide packages at:

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-for-open-source-cpp-development-on-mac-os-x

http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySide_Binaries_MacOSX

Installing QuTiP is the same as on linux. From the QuTiP directory:

>>> sudo python setup.py install

MICROSOFT WINDOWS
-----------------
The developers of QuTiP have not touched Windows in several years, and will be continuing this trend for the foreseeable future. 
Therefore we recommend the Enthought Python Distribution version 7.1 or higher to satisfy the QuTiP dependencies. 
QuTiP has also been reported to work out-of-the-box with Python(x,y). 
In Python(x,y), QuTiP may be installed using:

>>> python setup.py install build --compiler=mingw32
