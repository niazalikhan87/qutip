Rabi oscillations of an atom subject to a time-dependent classical driving field
================================================================================

The state of an atom subject to a classical driving field oscillates between its
ground and excited states, a phenomena known as Rabi oscillations. This example
gives a numerical demonstration of this effect by solving for the dynamics of
the time-dependent two-level Hamiltonian. This example also demonstrates how the
*list-string format* is used to define a time-dependent Hamiltonian.

The time-depdendent hamiltonian of the atom with a classical coherent driving
becomes time-independent in the rotating-frame approximation (RWA). The results
from evolving the system using the RWA Hamiltonian is also plotted.
