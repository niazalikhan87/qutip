The Dynamics of a Heisenberg Spin-1/2 Chain
===========================================

This example demonstrates how to calculate the dynamics of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, i.e., a sequence of two-level system (spin up or spin down) that are coupled to its nearest neighbors. The Hamiltonian for this system is

.. math::
    :label: ex_heisenberg_spin_chain_hamiltonian
    
    H = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_n^N h_n \sigma_z^n - \frac{1}{2} \sum_n^{N-1} \left[ J_x^n \sigma_x^n \sigma_x^{n+1} + J_y^n \sigma_y^n \sigma_y^{n+1} + J_z^n \sigma_z^n \sigma_z^{n+1}\right],

and the initial state used in the example is :math:`\left|\psi_0\right> = \left|\uparrow\downarrow\cdots\downarrow\right>`.
    
This example is slightly more complicated than the previous in that it dynamically builds a composite Hamiltonian and initial state for a configurable number of two-level system (parameter ``N=4`` in the program).
