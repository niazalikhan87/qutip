Measuring the distance between density matrices via the fidelity
================================================================

Here we measure the distance of a single mode (mode #1) of a trilinear Hamiltonian from that of a thermal density matrix characterized by the expectation value of the number of excitations in the mode at time t. Here the pump mode (mode #0) is assumed to be in a initial coherent state with the given excitation number.
