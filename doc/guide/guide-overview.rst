Organization
=============

QuTiP is designed to be a general toolbox for solving quantum optics like problems.  As such, the QuTiP framework is built from a large (and ever growing) library of functions; from :func:`qutip.states.basis` to :func:`qutip.wigner`.  The general organization of QuTiP, highlighting the important functions avalaible to the user is shown below.
