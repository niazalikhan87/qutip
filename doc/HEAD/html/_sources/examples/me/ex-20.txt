Two-qubit i-SWAP Gate
=====================

Dissipative i-Swap Gate vs. ideal gate. The accuracy of dissipative gate given by the fidelity.

This example demonstrates how to create a composite system of two-qubits, define
dissipation processor for each qubit, and solve for the dynamics of the system
using the standard Lindblad master equation. It also shows how to obtain expectation
values of select operators from the dynamics solver.
