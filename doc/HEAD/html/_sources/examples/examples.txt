***********************
QuTiP Example Scripts
***********************

QuTip includes 50 built in demo scripts from the selection of examples in this section that demonstrate the usage of QuTiP for solving a variety of problems.  To run the demo scripts, first load QuTiP ::

    >>> from qutip import *
    
and run the demos function::

    >>> demos()

This will generate the examples GUI, or a command line list of demos, depending on the availability of the graphics libraries.  If you do not have any graphics libraries installed, or they are disabled, then the demos function *must* be run from the terminal.

.. figure:: ../figures/demos.png
	:align: center
	:width: 6in

One advantage of the demos GUI is the ability to preview the code used in running the demos.  You may also copy and paste this code into another script and use it as a template for your own projects.  Of course, you can also obtain the codes for each of the bultin demos from their corresponding section in this examples documentation.

.. Note:: 
  
   All of these scripts have been thoughly tested and should run without any troubles.  However, for some users, there may be warnings generated in the terminal.  These are due to some compatibility issues with our depdendencies, and can be safely ignored.
