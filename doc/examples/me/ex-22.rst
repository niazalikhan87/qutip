Single-atom lasing in a Jaynes-Cumming-like system
==================================================

This example implements a simple model for single-atom lasing in a
Jaynes-Cumming-like system. In addition to the standard Jaynes-Cumming model,
there is an incoherent pumping that strive to create a population inversion
in the atom.

This examples demonstrates how reversed relaxation processes (note the
atomic collapse operators) can be used to introduce incoherent pump processes a
system.
