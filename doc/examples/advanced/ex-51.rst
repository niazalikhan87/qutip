Comparing the Lindblad and Bloch-Redfield master equations
==========================================================

This example compares the results of simulating a two-qubit system with
the Lindblad master equation solver and the Bloch-Redfield master equation.
The two models are not intended to be identical, and the results are not 
similar to each other, but the example demonstrates how a similar physical
situation can be modelled in different way and simulated with the two 
different solvers.

This example also demonstrates how to stack Bloch spheres in sub figures.
